# sqlibc unittests
Here live the unittests for each of the main libraries, if the one function gets too big, its tests are usually split off.
## TODO
* rethink how to do testing, we cant use minunit anymore as it relies on libC.
* tests for mem* functions
* tests for is* functions
* tests for str* functions
